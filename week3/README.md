# Overview

{So with this project the whole goal i came up with was to be able to create a functioning random password generator and to be able to generate random passwords for users for anything they may need. I was able to acomplish this}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

[Software Demo Video](I am trying to upload to youtube currently its just really slow trying to upload it.)

# Development Environment

Variables: Various variables are declared and used throughout the code, such as pass, demoPassword, listOfChar, password, specialCharsStream, numberStream, and lowerUpperStream.

Expressions: Expressions are used for mathematical operations and concatenations, such as in the generateSecurePassword() method where characters are concatenated to form the password.

Conditionals: Conditional statements (if-else) are used in the getRandomAlphabets() method to differentiate between generating upper case and lower case letters.

Loops: Streams and loops are used for iteration, such as in the methods getRandomSpecialChars(), getRandomNumbers(), and getRandomAlphabets() where streams and loops are utilized to generate random characters.

Functions: Functions or methods are defined and called throughout the code, such as generateSecurePassword(), getRandomSpecialChars(), getRandomNumbers(), and getRandomAlphabets().

Classes: The main class GeneratePassword is defined in the code.

Data structure from Java Collection Framework: The code uses List from the Java Collection Framework, specifically ArrayList, to store characters generated for the password.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I hope to make it more polised and look cleaner over all
- I will make a way to add it to a website so that i can see it on a htlm document
- I hope to be able to add something where i could use it to create pins and things like that for a use so thats a strech goal for the future.
