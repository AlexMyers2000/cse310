# Overview

So, as you can see in my main file that I created a Simple, calculator and see language. It works for adding subtracting and dividing and multiplication as well.

I just feel like it be fun to test the limits of it as well as being able just to see how the calculator functions and being able to understand it better and see if there's any room for improvement as well as being able to just have fun with it.

# Development Environment

The Language used in this program is C. 

stdio.h was the library used for this for the project to be able to make everything function

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Probably added more functions and buttons that they usually can use as in like what the calculator has on like an iPhone or iPad
- To work on the overall design to make it look a lot better than having it just running to terminal one to maybe add a play soccer window that I can run in so it doesn't have to be just random in vscode
- I hope to be able to eventually make it where you can use like an Apple Pencil or something like that and be able to have it understand the math and just show you step-by-step how to solve an answer.
